## Contribution

This is a one person project. Feedbacks are welcomed, but this project never going to be in production.

### Branching strategy

Because this is a one person project I choose [Trunk Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com) for branching.
In a team I would probably go with [Feature Branching](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow) with a protected main and Github on pull request action.
